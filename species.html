    <p style="text-align: left;">Kazuli are creatures that choose a base (plant, animal, or object) and use it to form their bodies. Their subspecies correspond to the absorbed base, and depending on the subspecies, they have certain traits.&nbsp;</p>

	<p style="text-align: left;">A Kazuli&#39;s body consists of slime, spores, and a pinch of magic. Kazuli have an anthropomorphic appearance and resemble animals, but still move on two legs (hind legs), and have arms (forelegs) with which they can pick up objects and use tools. The outside of their body is covered with skin that feels like a mushroom stalk. The skin can be covered with silky moss and grass that resembles hair and fur thanks to a pinch of magic. &nbsp;Inside their body is a skeleton of roots, compacted mucus, or bones that supports the body and makes it capable of grasping, jumping, running, and other activities! Inside the body of Kazuli except for the skeleton and absorbed object there is slime, which dissolves all the food, get into the body of Kazuli.</p>

	<p style="text-align: left;">Shape of the body (more or less plump), the volume of hips, torso, muscles and other things depends on the desire of the Kazulii itself. The only limitations are that Kazuli has no nipples and genitalia.</p>

	<p style="text-align: left;">Kazuli&#39;s head can be one of the variations given. Of course, depending on your artstyle, the head can be different, but the main thing is that the deviations are not too big and the shape remains recognizable.</p>

	<p style="text-align: left;">Kazuli have a small round nose on their face, which they use to touch other Kazuli or objects. By rubbing their noses on each other, Kazuli get to know each other and pass on information about themselves. These actions are mostly associated with friendly, familial, or romantic relationships.</p>

	<p style="text-align: left;">They also have a mouth on their face with a tongue inside, which is similar to a frog&#39;s tongue. Inside the mouth, the tongue is compressed like a spring, and when a Kazuli wants to grab something, it opens its mouth and shoots out its tongue, grabbing the object. The object sticks to the tongue and then the tongue returns to the mouth with the object. Once inside the Kazuli&#39;s body, the object moves in the slime and eventually dissolves, saturating the Kazuli.</p>

	<p style="text-align: left;">The kazuli skin can be any color and have any pattern as long as the pattern does not mimic other traits. The coloring can include gradient, text, numbers, abstract designs, and so on.<br>If you want your Kazuli to be canonical, it would be better not to use text and numbers in the pattern, as well as parts of human culture, since kazuli are not familiar with it and do not exist in the world together with humans.</p>

	<p style="text-align: left;">The number of fingers on a kazuli hand varies from four to five.</p>

    <img src="https://f2.toyhou.se/file/f2-toyhou-se/images/79834640_b1i5Vw4Qi5QOToC.png?1713184880" class="img-fluid"><br>
    
    <p style="text-align: left;">Each Kazuli has antennae located on the top of its head. The antennas help the Kazuli navigate through space. Inside them is an air locator that picks up the aura of other creatures or objects and emits its own aura. The air locator looks like an elongated tube twisted into a spiral.</p>

	<p style="text-align: left;">Antennas can be opaque and smooth, or opaque and with a spiral on the skin surface, or transparent if the &quot;transparency&quot; trait is applied to them. Antennas can be translucent down to the air locator.&nbsp;</p>

	<p style="text-align: left;">Depending on your artstyle, the antenna and air locator can be more or less rounded, but it is important that the rounded shape is still readable.</p>

	<p style="text-align: left;">Depending on the subspecies, the shape of the antennas may vary.&nbsp;The antennae have three small outgrowths on their tip. Depending on the shape of the antenna, there may be more or fewer branches, but by default there are three.</p>

    <div class="text-center"><h1 class="text-primary mb-3">Ear shells</h1></div>
    <img src="https://f2.toyhou.se/file/f2-toyhou-se/images/79844376_IB8gVVFsC2i1uhP.png?1712339400" class="img-fluid"><br>
    <img src="https://f2.toyhou.se/file/f2-toyhou-se/images/79897011_VymTYYPDd6Egkyr.png?1712339425" class="img-fluid"><br>
    
    <p style="text-align: left;">Kazuli has ear shells on the sides of its head. These allow them to find water and pick up the aura of creatures and objects underwater. This is more useful for those subspecies that live in bodies of water, but since all Kazuli do not need air, they can choose their own habitat and live even underwater, regardless of subspecies.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">The ear shell can be one of three possible shapes:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
		<li style="text-align: left;">The first shape is spiral or completely round.</li>
		<li style="text-align: left;">The second shape is round or spiral with a large outgrowth at the bottom with 2 smaller outgrowths at the bottom.</li>
		<li style="text-align: left;">The third shape - the ear drum is attached to the head by its thin part, which widens towards the end. At the end of the large part are two small outgrowths.</li>
    </ul>
	<p style="text-align: left;">The water locator works whether ear shell is visible or not, so full coverage with hair, clothing or accessories is allowed.&nbsp;</p>
	<p style="text-align: left;">Ear shells can take on various bizarre shapes if they have been <span style="color: #44a95f;">mutated</span>.</p>
</div><br>

<div class="card p-md-5 p-4">
    <div class="text-center"><h1 class="text-primary mb-3">Chest locator</h1></div>
    <img src="https://f2.toyhou.se/file/f2-toyhou-se/images/79895782_cHaEqFcGik8WCeN.png?1712339411" class="img-fluid"><br>
    
    <p style="text-align: left;">Kazuli has a chest locator on its chest, which regulates its body temperature and also recognizes the temperature of surrounding objects. The fire locator may be concealed by a flat or spiral circular shell, or may not be concealed at all and is on top of the body in its present appearance.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">The shell should also not have a hole in the middle. The fire locator is usually located in the middle of the shell, which is why there should be no holes in the middle of the shell either!</p>
    	<p style="text-align: left;">The shell that the fire locator is covered in can take any shape, but this is considered a <span style="color: #44a95f;">mutation</span>. It is important to keep the size of the shell - it should not be too big or too small.</p>
</div><br>

<div class="card p-md-5 p-4">
    <div class="text-center"><h1 class="text-primary mb-3">Tail tip</h1></div>
    <p style="text-align: left;">The tip of the tail has a ground locator, which Kazuli use to strike the ground when communicating with other individuals of their species. With the development of Kazuli society, the earth locator and tail tip are no longer relevant, as Kazuli now have speech and writing. The earth locator is most prominent in plant and cave Kazuli, but increasingly there are individuals that lack the earth locator and tail tip accordingly. When creating a character, you do not need to draw a tail tip unless you want your Kazuli to be able to communicate by beating on the ground.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">The tip of the tail is usually round, but can take on other unusual shapes if they have been <span style="color: #44a95f;">mutated</span>.</p>
</div><br>

<div class="card p-md-5 p-4">
    <div class="text-center"><h1 class="text-primary mb-3">Shell</h1></div>
    <p style="text-align: left;">At the base of the tail (the place where the tail grows from) is a shell that protects a special place in the tail - the one where the embryo can be found. Depending on the subspecies, the carapace may be more or less strong, made of different materials, or have spines or spurs on its surface.</p>
    
    <img src="https://f2.toyhou.se/file/f2-toyhou-se/images/80246270_wlm1JSo3gvJ2uHR.png" class="img-fluid"><br>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Plant subtype shells:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
		<li style="text-align: left;">a soft shell made of plant material and having a curl at the end of it;</li>
		<li style="text-align: left;">dissected leaf, has a single base but diverges at several ends;</li>
		<li style="text-align: left;">a solid leaf has one large shape and usually has no more than two ends;</li>
		<li style="text-align: left;">the floral shell consists of the leaves of the flowers and the offshoots attached to the flowers, such as whorls or stamens.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<img src="https://f2.toyhou.se/file/f2-toyhou-se/images/80276502_6FPEKqBeTyiJxTd.png" class="img-fluid"><br>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Forest, cave, avian subtype shells:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
		<li style="text-align: left;">For forest and cave subspecies, the tail shell is the same. Of course, it is worth considering that the cave subspecies also has a shell on the head, which distinguishes them from other subspecies;</li>
		<li style="text-align: left;">The avian subspecies may have the same carapace as the forest subspecies, but this subspecies also has a segmented shell and wing-imitating shell.</li>
	</ul>

    <p style="text-align: left;">River subspecies shells:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
		<li style="text-align: left;">Round seashell with curl;</li>
		<li style="text-align: left;">Triangular shell with curled shape;</li>
		<li style="text-align: left;">Shell with a hole that shows the tail;</li>
		<li style="text-align: left;">A bivalve shell that has parts at the top and bottom.</li>
	</ul>

    <p style="text-align: left;">Deepwater subspecies shells:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
		<li style="text-align: left;">The deep-sea shell has several variations, and can also create a combination of existing variations;</li>
		<li style="text-align: left;">Thin shell with ruffles;</li>
		<li style="text-align: left;">Thick shell with small oval spurs;</li>
		<li style="text-align: left;">A shell consisting of many rounded elongated outgrowths;</li>
		<li style="text-align: left;">A soft and light shell that looks like a cloud;</li>
		<li style="text-align: left;">A shell with a curl at the end with tentacles;</li>
		<li style="text-align: left;">Jellyfish-like shell.</li>
